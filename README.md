# MDevHub UI

> **Build Faster. Design Better.**

MDevHub UI is a growing collection of modern, responsive, and accessible UI components designed to help developers build beautiful web applications faster. The project focuses on clean design, smooth user experiences, reusable architecture, theme support, and zero-dependency implementation.

Components are built with performance, maintainability, and accessibility in mind, making them suitable for learning, experimentation, and real-world applications.

Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it locally using:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## 🔌 How to Integrate

You can integrate MDevHub UI components into your project in three different ways:

### Option A: Complete Bundle (Easiest)
Link the consolidated stylesheet in your HTML `<head>` and import the initialization scripts:

1. Copy the `styles/` folder into your project.
2. Link the stylesheet in your HTML:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
   ```
3. Copy the `scripts/` folder and include `scripts/app.js` as an ES Module:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="scripts/app.js"></script>
   ```

### Option B: Individual Components (Modular)
If you only need a specific component (e.g., Toast):

1. Copy its specific stylesheet: `styles/components/toast.css`. Ensure the base variables from `styles/theme.css` are active.
2. Copy its script file: `scripts/components/toast.js`.
3. In your main script, import and initialize the helper:
   ```javascript
   import { initToast, createToast } from "./components/toast.js";
   initToast();
   ```

### Option C: CDN Integration (Buildless)
You can directly link stylesheets and import modular JS from a CDN (such as unpkg) without downloading any files:

```html
<!-- Link consolidated styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/mdevhub-ui/styles/main.css">

<!-- Import and initialize components dynamically inside a module script -->
<script type="module">
  import { initAccordion, createToast } from "https://unpkg.com/mdevhub-ui/scripts/index.js";
  
  // Initialize accordion triggers
  initAccordion();
  
  // Build a test success toast
  createToast("success", "Successfully loaded via unpkg CDN!");
</script>
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ

#### 1. Why are skeleton loader transitions/shimmers missing?
Ensure you have copied both `styles/base.css` (or `styles/main.css`) AND the specific component styles. Transitions rely on CSS variable definitions mapping to the global `--skeleton-base` and animation configurations in `base.css`.

#### 2. Toast alerts show up but don't auto-dismiss?
Make sure that your scripts are loaded as type `module` (`<script type="module">`) and that `initToast()` is successfully called on DOM Content Loaded. The auto-dismiss handler runs on page initialization callbacks.

#### 3. Modal overlays close immediately on backdrop clicks?
Ensure that your overlay element has class `.modal-overlay` and the modal content box is wrapped inside `.modal`. The click listener checks if the click target is exactly the overlay background layer.
