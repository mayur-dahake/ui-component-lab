# MDevHub UI - Improvements Tracker

This file tracks the current product state, the biggest adoption gaps, and the work needed to make the component library easier for end users to integrate into their own projects.

## Current Status

### Actual Product Status
- Phase 1 completed
- Phase 2 completed
- Phase 3 completed
- Public docs and roadmap now reflect `v2.0` as the current release

### Reality Check
- Implemented component count is ahead of the documented roadmap
- The app already includes application-level components such as command palette, sidebar, notification center, and breadcrumb
- Integration guidance is still too light for outside users

## Main Adoption Problem

The biggest blocker is not the number of components. The biggest blocker is that users can see the demos, but they do not yet get a clear, repeatable path to copy a component into their own project and make it work with confidence.

## Priority Improvements

### P0 - Fix trust and clarity
- [x] Update `README.md` to reflect the real current version
- [x] Update `index.html` roadmap section to reflect actual progress
- [x] Update showcase copy that still says only Phase 1 and Phase 2 components are available
- [x] Update stats so the component count matches reality
- [x] Align `ROADMAP.md` with the current repository structure

### P1 - Improve integration experience
- [x] Add a "How to integrate" section to `README.md`
- [x] Explain which files users need to copy for a single component
- [x] Document required HTML structure for each component
- [x] Document required CSS and JS files for each component
- [x] Document initialization steps for each interactive component
- [x] Document expected data attributes and class hooks
- [x] Add a troubleshooting section for common integration mistakes

### P2 - Create real component documentation
- [ ] Add one documentation section or page per component
- [x] Include usage examples for all implemented components
- [ ] Add accessibility notes per component
- [ ] Add keyboard interaction notes per component
- [ ] Add customization options based on CSS variables and classes
- [x] Add "copy only this component" examples instead of generic snippets

### P3 - Standardize component APIs
- [x] Review all component init patterns for consistency
- [x] Prefer predictable naming such as `initComponentName()`
- [x] Define which components auto-initialize and which require manual init
- [x] Reduce hidden coupling between demo markup and component scripts
- [x] Document public methods, options, and events where relevant

### P4 - Make the library easier to consume
- [ ] Consider a `dist/` output for copy-paste use
- [x] Consider component-level entry files
- [x] Consider packaging for npm in a later phase
- [ ] Add framework integration examples for React and Angular
- [ ] Add Web Components strategy notes if that remains part of the roadmap

## Suggested Immediate Sequence

1. Fix roadmap and version messaging.
2. Improve `README.md` with integration instructions.
3. Create per-component docs for the currently implemented components.
4. Standardize the integration API where needed.
5. Then move on to Phase 4 components.

## Working Checklist by Area

### Documentation
- [x] README reflects actual state
- [x] Roadmap reflects actual state
- [x] Improvement tracker stays updated
- [x] Each component has usage docs
- [ ] Each component has accessibility docs

### Integration
- [x] Clear file copy instructions exist
- [x] Clear init instructions exist
- [ ] Example project structure exists
- [x] Troubleshooting notes exist

### Product
- [x] Phase labels match implementation
- [x] Stats match implementation
- [x] Showcase copy matches implementation

## Notes

### Current Recommendation
Before adding more components, focus on integration and documentation quality. That will make the existing work much more valuable to users and much easier to showcase professionally.

### Update Rule
Whenever we complete an improvement, update this file first so it stays the single source of truth for progress tracking.
